# sudokuSolver
Goal of this project is build a sudoku solver with image input. 

## Technologies
* We are going to use opencv libraries to read in a picture of a suduko game and use the Z3 Theorem solver to solve the sudoku.

* The WebService itself is implemented via Django Rest Framework and Django itself (backend). 
* For the web application (frontend) we plan to use Angular and Ionic.
